# Horrible Resume, really.
> Just another typical resume website.

Literally took all the common aesthetic website and merged them together, add a little bit of duct tape and terrible coding.

Share this as a joke with your friends, maybe. I'm asian Singaporean, jokes might be tailored to the Asian community, or the extremely humble and modest people. I don't know, I can't see when I start laughing.

## Made With

Bootstrap v4.1.3 , jQuery JavaScript Library v3.3.1,
and a ton of terrible code taken from everywhere(open source only, I'm not a monster)

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create a new Pull Request

Honestly, this is my first GitHub Project, PR anything.

I'm terrible at Web Development and would love if any of you have any feedback/assistance.
