[Website Here](https://vibrant-thompson-82aa7b.netlify.com/)

Literally took all the common aesthetic website and merged them together, add a little bit of duct tape and terrible coding.

Share this as a joke with your friends, maybe. I'm asian Singaporean, jokes might be tailored to the Asian community, or the extremely humble and modest people. I don't know, my life is a joke

## Made With

Bootstrap v4.1.3 , jQuery JavaScript Library v3.3.1,
and a ton of terrible code taken from everywhere
